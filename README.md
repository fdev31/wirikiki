_Wirikiki_ aims at being a productivity oriented **markdown notebook**.
It's compatible with the most common features supported by GitHub's markdown and adds a few other.

In comparison to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) it lacks the python notes but brings:

- speed / **light** footprint
- **simplicity** of use
- **uncluttered** UI supporting both **dark & bright modes**
- more **advanced markdown support** via [markItDown](https://markitdown.netlify.app/) and plugins and [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) for the editor
- auto **archival** (using git)

# Installation

## Building

3 alternative ways to get a runnable code:

- download a release (TODO)
- `make dist`
- manual installation

```
sh ./makevueApps.sh
npm install
DIST=1 ./node_modules/.bin/rollup -c rollup.config.js
```

# Usage

Just execute `run.sh`, it will automatically install the python virtual environment.

## Zero-install mode

You can just open the html file to get a degraded experience, data will not be saved.

# Advanced usage

Basic git support is provided, to enable it just type `git init` in the `myKB` folder.

```shell
cd myKB
git init
```

# Dependencies

- **Python 3**
  - if you want to run it **without the virtualenv** you will need the following python packages:
    - aiofiles
    - fastapi
    - uvicorn
- nodejs and npm (BUILD ONLY)
- inotify-tools (DEV ONLY)

# Developers note

This is built using
[Vue.js version 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) for the front
and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the server side.
